🇬🇧🌍 Introducing Lingua Bubble – A Fun Way to Learn Languages!

We've developed a multilingual mobile app called Lingua Bubble, which offers an AI-powered, game-based language learning experience! It's now available in beta.
We’ve just launched Lingua Bubble, a multilingual mobile app designed to make language learning engaging and
interactive.
Now available on iOS and Android, Lingua Bubble supports 9 different languages:
🇬🇧 English | 🇩🇪 German | 🇹🇷 Turkish | 🇮🇹 Italian | 🇵🇹 Portuguese | 🇫🇷 French | 🇷🇺 Russian | 🇪🇸 Spanish | 🇰🇷 Korean

Once you select a language and your level (A1–C2), you can explore 5 fun learning games:

🎯 Scrambled Word – Unscramble the letters to find the right word.
✍️ Sentence Completion – Fill in the missing word using scrambled hints.
🧩 Sentence Builder – Reorder words to form correct sentences.
🎤 Speech Game – Listen to sentences and find the missing word by ear.
🔊 Voice Match – Listen and match the correct spoken sentence from multiple options.

Each game helps you improve vocabulary, comprehension, and pronunciation in a playful way.
